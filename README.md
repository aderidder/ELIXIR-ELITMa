# Introduction
Initial version of a GitHub repository for ELIXIR-ELITMa, based on the ELIXIR toolkit theme.

Some things to keep in mind:
* _data/modules.yml
  * Contains information about the modules, which is used in several places:
    * index.md --> table at the bottom
    * module's main.md --> tabbed pane at the top
* Tabbed pane at the top of a module's main.md generated by including module_header_tabbed.html
  * To be able to grab the appropriate content for the page from the modules.yml it uses the id from the page's front matter to find the id in modules.yml
